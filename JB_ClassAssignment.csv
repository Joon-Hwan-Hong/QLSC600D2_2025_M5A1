A randomized trial of blood donor iron repletion on red cell quality for transfusion and donor cognition and well-being,2022,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9749410/,Matthew Schinwald,2 (confidential),3,3,3,3,5,"This paper was conducted using data obtained from a separate study. Most of the necessary information to replicate this study was available in a supplemental appendix. The original study was extremely thorough and even replicated the primary analysis and descriptive statistics with two separate statisticians. The only minor criticism of the study protocol is that participant recruitment wasn't consistently done the same way; sometimes by email, or telephone, or mail. All of these methods have an effect on loss-to-follow up biases"
"Ferritin-guided iron supplementation in whole blood donors: optimal dosage, donor response, return and efficacy (FORTE)â€”a randomised controlled trial protocol",2022,https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/bmjopen/12/3/e056316.full.pdf,Matthew Schinwald,2 (confidential),3 (really 2 but the second bullet is N/A),2,1,3,4,"Donor eligibility was assessed using a donor health questionnaire. To be eligible, donors must be in ""good health"", which is an ambiguous term. To determine the eligibility requirements within this questionnaire, a separate study was cited. This study provided some limited insite as to the fields of the health questionnaire, but overall it was ambiguous. Interestingly, two analysis softwares were used (SPSS and R). The version of SPSS was identified but the version of R was not described. There was little information on data processing, however this paper is only about a study protocol."
Deferral rate variability in blood donor eligibility assessment,2018,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/trf.14984,Matthew Schinwald,2 (confidential),2,2,3,3,3,"Two different statistical softwares were used, and it wasn't described which software performed which analyses. This study also used regression models, but there was no information on how the regression model assumptions were met (e.g. whether QQ plots or histograms were used to check normality). Additionally, the number of observations used for the regression models was not mentioned. There was no mention about variable selection for building multivariable models (e.g. backwards elimination, etc.). Overall the statistical analyses performed were not sufficiently described."
Coenzyme Q10 trapping in mitochondrial complex I underlies LeberÕs hereditary optic neuropathy,2023,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2304884120,Ryan Huang,3,2,3,3,3,5,"This paper is published under open access. It is a molecular dynamics simulation study of mitochondrial complex I. All the simulation and analysis codes and data are openly available and maintained in an online repository (Zenodo). Therefore, this paper has good data availablility and accessibility. The study design involves comparing a mutated protein structure with the original wildtype form. The molecular dynamics simulation generated enough data for statistical comparison. In terms of potential of research practice, it is unlikely that the authors performed the simulation and the analysis blinded. However, since the analysis codes are made publicaly available, questionable statistical manipulation is unlikely. In the paper itself, the simulation and analysis pipeline were only briefly described. It would be hard to reproduce the results based on the methods section; readers probably need to go into the available codes to pindown the exact steps. This study is examining the structural characteristics and chemical kinetics of mitochondrial complex I in wildtype form and a mutant form relevant to Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy. The mutant itself is relatively common in the disease population. The based structure used for simulation was obtained from cryo-EM data. Overall, this is an open access paper with all of its codes and data available for download online. The only practical barrier to reproduce the research would be limitations of computation resources."
The morphology of an infarct in nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy,2003,https://doi.org/10.1016/S0161-6420(03)00804-2,Ryan Huang,1,3,3,3,1,4,"This paper presents a pathological examination of the optic nerve of an patient with nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. The raw processed pathological sample is probably kept at the institution, and the scanned pictures were included in the paper. However, the raw scanned pictures were not available online since it is a relatively old paper, from a time when online repository is not widely used. There is no comparison with normal optic nerve sample in the paper. The pathologist probably knows the diagnosis of the patient, so analysis was not performed blinded. The pathological processing and image acquisition and processing were well-described in the paper. However, some details were omitted (such as the concentration of staining used), but this is typical practice in medical pathology papers. This paper is only based on one patient, since it is really hard to obtain patient samples with the rare disease. The pathological processing chemicals and microscopes are common in medical facilities and not expensive. However, patient sample would be really hard to obtain for such rare eye disease."
Finite element modeling of CNS white matter kinematics: use of a 3D RVE to determine material properties,2013,https://doi.org/10.3389/fbioe.2013.00019,Ryan Huang,1,2,3,2,2,3,"This paper presents a finite-element simulation study that investigates the material properties of CNS white matter under injury. The simulation code and raw results are not provided, but the authors mentioned the software they used with version number (one requires paid license). The parameters used for the model are justified with links to previous studies. The results are supported by the methods outlined."
Attenuation of high-frequency (30Ð200_Hz) thalamocortical EEG rhythms as correlate of anaesthetic action: evidence from dexmedetomidine,2017,https://doi.org/10.1093/bja/aex329,Ryan Huang,1,3,3,2,2,4,"This paper studies the effect of anesthesia on rat field potential recordings. The conclusion is well-supported by the method outlined, with enough experimental details. However, the raw recordings are not openly available. The statistical analysis and tools used are also well-described. Some of the analysis softwares are commonly used and available, but require a license or subscription."
Critical involvement of the thalamus and precuneus during restoration of consciousness with physostigmine in humans during propofol anaesthesia: a positron emission tomography study,2011,https://doi.org/10.1093/bja/aeq415,Ryan Huang,1,3,3,3,2,4,"This paper studies the effect of anesthesia on human brain activity using PET scans. The conclusion is well-supported by the method outlined, with enough experimental details. However, the raw PET signals are not openly available. The statistical analysis and tools used are also well-described. The analysis softwares are freely available online on McConnell Brain Imaging Center's GitHub."
