#REF!,A randomized trial of blood donor iron repletion on red cell quality for transfusion and donor cognition and well-being,2022,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9749410/,Matthew Schinwald,2 (confidential),3,3,3,3,"This paper was conducted using data obtained from a separate study. Most of the necessary information to replicate this study was available in a supplemental appendix. The original study was extremely thorough and even replicated the primary analysis and descriptive statistics with two separate statisticians. The only minor criticism of the study protocol is that participant recruitment wasn't consistently done the same way; sometimes by email, or telephone, or mail. All of these methods have an effect on loss-to-follow up biases",5,

To be eligible, donors must be in ""good health"", which is an ambiguous term. To determine the eligibility requirements within this questionnaire, a separate study was cited. This study provided some limited insite as to the fields of the health questionnaire, but overall it was ambiguous. Interestingly, two analysis softwares were used (SPSS and R). The version of SPSS was identified but the version of R was not described. There was little information on data processing, however this paper is only about a study protocol.",4,

This study also used regression models, but there was no information on how the regression model assumptions were met (e.g. whether QQ plots or histograms were used to check normality). Additionally, the number of observations used for the regression models was not mentioned. There was no mention about variable selection for building multivariable models (e.g. backwards elimination, etc.). Overall the statistical analyses performed were not sufficiently described.",3,
