How good is the literature review in the introduction? ""Quality of experimental design"" and ""Description of methods"" kind of overlap - merge? I think we should remove any mention of cost of equipment, that is a barrier to equity in research not reproducibility/replicability (discussion for another day).  This paper is difficult to replicate because it is location and time specific (environmental surveillance) "

Are too many assumptions made to reach a conclusion? This particular paper is difficult to replicate because it is location and time specific (and poorly designed)

When I returned to it I mostly reiterated the points I had made previously. I am also not sure how we are deciding the values to put int the replicability and reproducibility category - is it an average of the blue columns or just a general observation?
